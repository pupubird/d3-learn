        <ul>
            <li>D3.js is a client side library that works alongside with HTML,
                CSS and
                JavaScript. It’s important to have an
                editor that supports all 3 in order to use it.</li>
            <li>While D3 is used on the browser, we’ll be requesting data from
                external
                sources which requires a server. You can
                not open up HTML files directly in the browser.</li>
            <li>I recommend using WebStorm by JetBrains. It is a premium editor
                that
                will take care of creating a server for
                you. This will allow you to focus more on your code.</li>
            <li>A free alternative is XAMPP. XAMPP is a program that creates a
                server
                and bundles other programs useful for web
                development. It’s not required to use or know those programs for
                D3.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="understanding-d3-data-visualization">Understanding D3 &amp; Data
            Visualization</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Data visualization is the ability to tell a story or an idea
                through
                visuals and graphics. As the old saying
                goes, “A picture is worth a thousand words.”</li>
            <li>Data visualizations can help users explore patterns in their
                data and
                even notice disruptions.</li>
            <li>5 tips for creating great visualizations are: Understanding your
                audience, choosing an appropriate visual,
                remove clutter, draw attention using shape size &amp; color, and
                lastly
                telling a story.</li>
            <li>D3 stands for data driven documents. It’s important to
                understand that
                data is what drives the visualization,
                NOT the other way around.</li>

        <h3 id="javascript-arrays-objects">JavaScript Arrays &amp; Objects</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Arrays are a way to store multiple values in 1 variable. Arrays
                can hold
                any type of data including numbers,
                strings, Booleans, functions and objects.</li>
            <li>Arrays will automatically assign each value inside it a
                position. A
                position is a way to reference a value in
                the array. Positions start at 0 and go up as more values are
                added.</li>
            <li>Objects are similar to arrays that can hold multiple values in a
                single
                variable. The difference is that you
                have to name your values along with the value.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="what-is-svg">What is SVG</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. It’s a special image
                format
                rather than the traditional jpg, jpeg, gif,
                png and bmp extensions.</li>
            <li>SVG images are created and edited through code. Not something
                that can
                necessarily be created sing cameras or
                image manipulation software like Photoshop.</li>
            <li>What makes SVG so great is that you can resize images without
                loss of
                quality. Image maintain their consistency
                and shape without having pixelated edges.</li>
            <li>SVG images require a lot of resources so you should only use
                them for
                basic images.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="creating-svg-images">Creating SVG Images</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>To create an SVG image you use the <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code>
                element.
                Most web browsers support SVG images by
                default so you shouldn’t face any compatibility issues.</li>
            <li>SVG images can have CSS classes and JavaScript events applied to
                them.
                This makes them easier to work with
                rather than a plain image.</li>
            <li>Not all CSS properties are supported. Some elements related to
                SVG
                require certain values and properties. You’ll
                learn what those are throughout this course.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="svg-rectangles">SVG Rectangles</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>SVG rectangle elements require that you set the width and height
                attributes. Otherwise nothing will appear on
                the screen.</li>
            <li>The fill attribute allows you to change the color of a SVG
                shape. You
                can’t use the background-color property on
                a SVG element. It will be ignored. The value for the fill can be
                named
                colors, rgb, hex and hsv.</li>
            <li>The stroke property will apply a border around a shape. Just
                like the
                fill property, this can only be applied to
                shapes. You also need to set the stroke-width or else the stroke
                won’t
                appear.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="svg-circles-ellipses-and-lines">SVG Circles, Ellipses, and Lines</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The circle element requires that you define the r attribute
                which will
                set its radius. The radius is the
                distance from the center of the circle to any of it’s edges.</li>
            <li>The coordinate system works a bit differently. Circles are moved
                from
                their center points so you need to use the
                attributes cx and cy appropriately.</li>
            <li>An ellipse works similar to the circle element, but you’re
                required to
                set the radius for the x and y axis.</li>
            <li>Lines require that you set 2 coordinates which can be set using
                x1, y1,
                x2, and y2. Lines don’t have a fill so
                you need to use the stroke attribute to set the color.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="svg-polygons-polylines">SVG Polygons &amp; Polylines</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Polygons are shapes with 3 or more straight sides. With the SVG
                polygon
                element you can create complex shapes.
            </li>
            <li>The polygon element requires 1 attribute which is the points.
                The points
                must be a set of coordinates where SVG
                will take care of drawing lines between them in order.</li>
            <li>Polylines are similar to polygons except polylines will not be
                closed.
                Despite the name, polylines will also
                have a fill. Set the fill attribute to none to have no fill.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="svg-paths">SVG Paths</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Path elements allow you to create complex shapes. You can create
                sides
                that are either straight or curved.</li>
            <li>You are also allowed to create multiple shapes using one
                element.</li>
            <li>The path element works differently than the other shapes. You
                are
                required to input commands along with your
                coordinates to instruct SVG how to draw your shapes.</li>
            <li>There are 2 types of commands which are absolute and relative.
                Absolute
                commands are created using uppercase
                letters. Relative commands are created using lowercase letters.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="svg-text">SVG Text</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The text element allows you to create text inside SVG. Your text
                may not
                appear unless you set the x and y
                coordinates.
                Naturally, SVG will not be able to break your text into multiple
                lines.
                In these cases you may want to use the
                tspan element to create multi line text.</li>
            <li>You can use regular HTML inside the text element, but you may
                need to
                apply special attributes in order for them
                to work. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="svg-definitions-and-groups">SVG Definitions and Groups</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Definitions allow you to create reusable elements. The benefit
                is that
                you won’t have to input the same values
                each time. Just define it once and you’re set!</li>
            <li>Any elements defined inside a definition will not be displayed.
                You have
                to use the use element and pass in the
                ID of the definition in order to display it.</li>
            <li>To group multiple elements together you can use the g element.
                The g
                element can hold any kind of shape and
                allows you to manage complex shapes easier.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="svg-text-paths">SVG Text Paths</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You can create fancy text effects using text paths. Text paths
                allow you
                to use paths for text to be written on.
                To create a text path you must first create a definition using
                the path
                element. You can use any commands and
                coordinates you want.</li>
            <li>Then you need to apply the textPath element to the text element
                and pass
                in the ID. The text must also be inside
                this element for the path to take effect.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="svg-clip-paths">SVG Clip Paths</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Clip paths allow you to hide certain parts of a shape using
                custom
                paths. Anything inside will appear while
                anything outside will disappear.</li>
            <li>Clip paths only apply to elements they’re applied to. If a shape
                that
                doesn’t have a clip path applied to it,
                but is touching the clip path, then it will still remain
                unaffected.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="creating-svg-elements-with-illustrator">Creating SVG Elements
            with
            Illustrator</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Illustrator can be used to create SVG images. Just make sure you
                select
                svg as the file format when exporting.
            </li>
            <li>SVG files will have special attributes when you’re creating them
                as a
                separate file. This is just for the
                browser to better understand everything inside.</li>
            <li>D3 is used with SVG to create graphs and charts so be prepared
                to use it
                when we get started in the next
                section!</li>

        <h3 id="setting-up">Setting Up</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>It’s always good practice to set the character encoding of your
                HTML
                documents. When working with D3 you’ll be
                dealing with a lot of data so it’s important that everything
                works as
                intended.</li>
            <li>Github is a site that allows you to store and share code with
                other
                developers. Most libraries are hosted on
                Github.</li>
            <li>Most libraries come with a minified version which is meant for
                production when you’re finished your project. Use
                the standard version during development.</li>
            <li>D3 is split into multiple libraries for developers who only want
                to load
                what they’re going to use. The main
                library includes everything at once for your convenience.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="selections">Selections</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>As far as D3 is concerned, data is only text and numbers. Other
                types of
                data such as images, audio files, and
                videos will not work with D3 as “data”.</li>
            <li>D3 bridges the gap between your data and the visualization (the
                HTML and
                CSS). </li>
            <li>Selections are objects that represent the HTML on your page. D3
                will
                take care of creating these objects and
                fill them with properties/methods for you to use.</li>
            <li>If you call the append() method, then the selection will also be
                updated
                to the element created.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="manipulating-selections">Manipulating Selections</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Transformation methods are functions that change how an element
                looks
                internally. This includes attributes or
                the elements inside it.</li>
            <li>The attr() method will add the attribute you pass in. It’s
                important to
                note that this will completely override
                an attribute if it already exists.</li>
            <li>A better alternative to adding classes to an element is by using
                the
                classed() method. If a class exists, then
                it will not be removed if you try to add it.</li>
            <li>You should always make sure you know what’s being returned. Some
                methods
                will return the current selection or an
                entire new one. Check the documentation to make sure.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="binding-data">Binding Data</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>D3 has something called a waiting room when you bind data to an
                element.
                If data can’t be bound to an element,
                then the data will be placed inside the waiting room.</li>
            <li>To access the data in the waiting room you need to call the
                enter()
                function. This will begin looping through
                each piece of data.</li>
            <li>The minute you create an element in the loop, D3 will bind the
                current
                piece of data to that element. This is
                done automatically for you.</li>
            <li>It’s always good practice to put the data into the waiting room
                rather
                than having elements prepared already.
            </li>
        </ul>

            <li>Each element has access to the data it’s binded to. You can use
                this as
                an opportunity to change the outcome of
                the element.
                Each transformation function can accept an anonymous function
                which will
                passed the current data in the loop.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="loading-data-externally">Loading Data Externally</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>D3 supports 3 file formats which are plain text, csv and json.
                You can
                load each of these using functions
                provided by the D3 request library.</li>
            <li>CSV files are comma separated values. Each line is considered a
                row.
                Each comma separated value is considered a
                column. The first row is used as the column names.</li>
            <li>D3 takes the time to convert CSV data into objects and arrays
                depending
                on how it’s formatted.</li>
            <li>JSON files hardly get affected as they’re objects and arrays to
                begin
                with. It’s preferable to use JSON code
                rather than CSV for consistency.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>D3 can be used to create any type of visualization. It’s not
                biased
                towards nay chart or graph.</li>
            <li>Adobe color is a tool that allows you to find great color
                combinations
                and even build your own.</li>
            <li>You can use the data to change the outcome of the bar/chart.
                Most
                commonly used to manipulate the height or
                height.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="random-data">Random Data</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Generating Random data can help battle test your graph as it
                allows you
                to cover more scenarios.</li>
            <li>There are situations where clients may not be able to provide
                you data
                so you’ll be responsible for generating
                dummy data in the mean time.</li>
            <li>The D3 random library takes care of generating random data for
                you.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="using-svg">Using SVG</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Moving SVG elements requires that you change their x and y
                coordinates.
                The X coordinate goes from left to right
                and the y coordinate goes from top to bottom.</li>
            <li>If you’re reusing values, then you should store it in a
                variable. This
                makes it easy to change later on if you
                ever need to.</li>
            <li>Labels are a way to identify a shape. Users will be able to
                better
                understand compare your visualization if you
                provide labels.</li>
            <li>Text anchoring is special to SVG. You can determine whether text
                gets
                pushed form its side or center point.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="scatter-plot">Scatter Plot</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Scatter plots allow you to chart large amounts of data. They are
                circles
                that represent 2 pieces of data. They
                can also vary in size to show more impact over others.</li>
            <li>Creating a scatter plot is similar to creating a bar graph. You
                create
                the elements, bind the data, create more
                elements for the data and add details.</li>
            <li>You can use the join() function to combine arrays to strings.
                This can
                be useful for displaying coordinates
                stored in arrays.</li>
            <li>Math is used to position and set the size of elements. D3 can
                take care
                of the more complex operations so you
                don’t have to.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="scales">Scales</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Scales are functions that take your data and will lower or
                increase the
                values so that they can be used for
                visualization.</li>
            <li>The input domain is the original set of data. It’s the highest
                and
                lowest numbers in your data.</li>
            <li>The output range is the numbers that the original data should be
                scaled
                to. These would usually be size of the
                viewing area.</li>
            <li>The D3 array library is a utility library that provides
                functions for
                working with arrays no matter how complex.
                It’s included in the core by default so you don’t need to do
                anything to
                set it up.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="applying-scales-to-visualizations">Applying Scales to
            Visualizations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The d3.max() and d3.min() functions can be passed in accessor
                functions
                for complex array and object structures.
            </li>
            <li>An accessor function is a function that returns a value that’s
                used for
                grabbing certain data from an object or
                array.</li>
            <li>Adding padding to your visualizations is common so that shapes
                and text
                don’t get cut off from the viewing area.
            </li>
            <li>You can reverse the range and D3 will take care of scaling the
                values
                appropriately for you.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="exploring-more-scales">Exploring More Scales</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>D3 provides various scales for various scenarios. An official
                list of
                scales can be found on the D3 Scales
                library.</li>
            <li>Each scale can be used for scaling different types of shapes
                such as the
                scaleSqrt() function for circles.</li>
            <li>Some scales are used for data that don’t contain numeric values
                such as
                colors or categorical data.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="time-scales">Time Scales</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Dates in your data will most likely come in a format that
                neither D3 or
                JavaScript can understand. D3 only works
                with Date Objects.</li>
            <li>There are a set of functions that will take care of reading your
                formatted dates and converting them into date
                objects to use with scales and vice versa.</li>
            <li>MomentJS is also a popular library for converting dates. You can
                use
                this if you’re comfortable with it.</li>
            <li>D3’s time scale will read your dates and convert them into
                numbers that
                can be used to visualize your data.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="adding-an-axis">Adding an Axis</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>An axis is a line with ticks that provide a way to visually
                measure the
                distance between certain points in a
                graph. D3 provides a set of functions for creating an axis.</li>
            <li>The axisTop() and axisBottom() functions are used for creating a
                horizontal axis. The axisLeft() and axisRight()
                functions are used for creating a vertical axis.</li>
            <li>Unlike scales, these functions will draw the SVG elements for
                you. It’s
                good practice to store these generated
                elements inside a group so they can be moved and managed easily.</li>
            <li>You can use CSS to refine the outcome of your SVG shapes. The
                more
                cleaner a shape looks, the more resources is
                required to render it.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="refining-the-axis-and-adding-the-y-axis">Refining the Axis and
            adding
            the Y Axis</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The ticks() function allows you to set a number of ticks an axis
                should
                have. The number will only be taken as a
                suggestion.</li>
            <li>The tickValues() function will allow you to completely control
                how many
                ticks are outputted along with the
                actual values themselves. D3 will take the time to space them
                out.</li>
            <li>The tickFormat() function will allow you to format the text that
                gets
                outputted for each tick. You are provided
                the data for each tick so you can manipulate it appropriately.</li>

        <h3 id="ordinal-scales">Ordinal Scales</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ordinal scales are used to convert categorical data into numbers
                that
                can be used for your visualizations.</li>
            <li>The definition of ordinal is relating to a “thing’s” position in
                a
                series.</li>
            <li>D3 will evenly distribute your ordinal data. It’s important to
                note that
                it will apply padding at the end.</li>
            <li>A band is a specific set of numbers in a range. The set of
                numbers are
                usually distributed evenly in a pattern.
                Not always, but that’s usually the case.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="refining-the-bar-graph">Refining the Bar Graph</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You can use numeric data as ordinal data if you wish. Instead of
                using
                the numbers themselves, you can use their
                index.</li>
            <li>The band width is the distance between number in the band range.
                D3
                provides a function called bandwidth() which
                will calculate this for you without the padding.</li>
            <li>Band scales were made specifically for bar charts so it’s
                recommend you
                use them.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="updating-the-bar-graph">Updating the Bar Graph</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>There are 3 situations you’ll find yourself in when it comes to
                updating
                data. This can be a change in your
                original date, an addition or a removal.</li>
            <li>Changes in data usually occur during an event. By default, D3
                supports
                all JavaScript events by using the on()
                function on a selection.</li>
            <li>The reverse() function is a JavaScript array function that will
                take
                care of reversing the values in your array.
            </li>
            <li>You can bind your data to the elements again to let D3 be aware
                of the
                change. You will have to redraw only the
                elements affected and only change the attributes that were
                affected.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="transitions-and-animations">Transitions and Animations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Applying a transition is as simple as applying the transition()
                function
                your current selection. D3 will take
                care of animating the attributes for you.</li>
            <li>Transitions can only be applied to attributes that currently
                exist.
                Otherwise there will be no animation
                applied.</li>
            <li>You can control the duration of your transition by applying the
                duration() function. The length of time is
                measured in milliseconds.</li>
            <li>You can delay a transition by applying the delay() function.
                This is
                also measured in milliseconds. Be careful
                with your delays as it can be easy to ruin the user experience
                with long
                delays and animations.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="updating-the-data">Updating the Data</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If your data changes, then your visualization will not reflect
                that
                accurately. You’ll need to update the domain
                before you do anything else. Just call the domain() function
                again and
                pass in the new minimum and maximum
                values.</li>

        <h3 id="reinforcing-transitions-and-animations">Reinforcing Transitions
            and
            Animations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The axis needs to be updated when your data changes drastically.
                If not,
                then the data can be inaccurately read.
            </li>
            <li>You do not need to pass in the scales again as D3 will be able
                to detect
                those changes for you and update the
                axis appropriately.</li>
            <li>You are allowed to animate the axis by chaining the
                transition(),
                delay(), and duration() functions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="refining-the-scatterplot">Refining the Scatterplot</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Clip paths allow you to hide portions of a shape that appears
                outside of
                its viewing area.</li>
            <li>It’s more efficient to group your elements together and then
                apply a
                clipping path rather than applying clip
                paths to each element individually.</li>
            <li>Transitions have events called start and end. The start event is
                triggered when the transitioned begins. The end
                transition event is triggered when the transition ends. Each
                element
                will have their own transition events.</li>
            <li>You can have multiple transitions occurring on the page.
                However, you
                can’t have multiple transitions applied to
                the same element at the same time or else the previous
                transitions will
                be cancelled.</li>

        <h3 id="adding-data">Adding Data</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>When you add new data, you need to update your scales domain for
                the new
                minimum and maximum values.</li>
            <li>The data() function returns a selection. The selection being the
                elements that have data binded to them.</li>
            <li>The elements that have data binded to them and the elements you
                create
                after moving them from the waiting room
                are 2 different selections.</li>
            <li>You can merge separate selections by calling the merge()
                function. This
                function must be chained after a
                selection and the selection it will be merged with must be
                passed into
                the function.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="removing-data">Removing Data</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>D3 has an exit mode which will store references to elements that
                have no
                data bound to them. You can call the
                exit() function loop through these elements.</li>
            <li>If you apply the remove() function to a transition, then the
                function
                will wait until the transition is
                finished.</li>
            <li>Data joins are the process of binding a value in your data to an
                element. It’s the connection between the data
                in your array and elements on the page.</li>
            <li>By default, D3 will use index ordering which means the first
                value in
                the array is bound to the first element on
                the page. So on and so forth.</li>

                hovers.</li>
            <li>The on() function is provided the data and index which contains
                the
                value to each element in the array.</li>
            <li>JavaScript animations and transitions give you more power as
                opposed to
                CSS. Use JavaScript if you need that
                power and flexibility. Otherwise, use CSS.</li>
            <li>Set the CSS property pointer-events to none if you don’t want
                events
                applied to a certain element.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="sorting">Sorting</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The d3.ascending() function will sort data and elements from
                smallest to
                biggest.</li>
            <li>The d3.descending() function will sort data and elements from
                biggest to
                smallest.</li>
            <li>You can give your transitions names to prevent collisions. This
                will
                mean you will have to interrupt animations
                manually by using the interrupt() function.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="fun-with-tooltips">Fun with Tooltips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>There are 3 solutions for creating tooltips. The first is by
                using the
                text SVG element. This element can’t be
                customized, but it’s the simplest solution.</li>
            <li>You can create tooltips using SVG, but this is the most complex
                solution
                since SVG has a complex shape and
                coordinate system.</li>
            <li>The final solution is to just use plain HTML. The CSS position
                properties make it easy to create tooltips. This
                is one of the solutions where using HTML and SVG is ideal.</li>

        <h3 id="line-charts">Line Charts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The D3 shape contains functions for creating complex shapes
                using the
                path element exclusively.</li>
            <li>The d3.line() function will create a function that you can use
                to draw
                complex lines. It only draws 1 line and
                not multiple lines.</li>
            <li>The datum() function will bind 1 piece of data to 1 element.
                There’s no
                need to perform looping or use the enter
                mode.
                If your data contains negative numbers, then it’s up to you to
                decide
                how to approach that. The defined function
                allows you to filter values in your data.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="improving-the-visualization">Improving the Visualization</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Area charts are similar to line charts. You create the
                functions, then
                bind the data to an element and call the
                function to begin drawing the area.</li>
            <li>Areas created by drawing 2 invisible lines. Anything in between
                those
                lines gets filled in with a color.
                You have the option of specifying the coordinates together or
                specifying
                them separately.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="pie-donut-charts">Pie &amp; Donut Charts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Pie and Donut charts are drawn by drawing the slices rather than
                the
                whole circle itself. These slices are then
                combined together.</li>
            <li>Arcs are the shapes D3 will draw for you using the d3.arc()
                function.
                Each arc has an inner radius and outer
                radius. By setting the inner radius, you can make pie charts
                into t
                charts.</li>
            <li>Layouts are functions that convert your current existing data
                into data
                that can be used to draw different types
                of charts.</li>
            <li>Radians are used to measure the degrees of angles in arcs. D3
                will take
                care of that conversion for you.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="stacked-bar-charts">Stacked Bar charts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Stack layouts are used for creating stack charts like stack bar
                graphs
                or stack area charts.</li>
            <li>Stack layouts work by categorizing your data and assigning start
                and end
                positions.</li>
            <li>You need to call the keys() function to set the categories.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="force-layouts">Force Layouts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Nodes are a unit of data. They’re mostly used in hierarchies of
                data
                like an HTML document.</li>
            <li>Along with your usual data you also need to specify the
                relationships
                between the data.</li>
            <li>To create a force, you need to use the forceSimulation()
                function and
                pass in the different forces using the
                force() function. This function will determine the behavior of
                the
                visualization.</li>
            <li>D3 will examine the data’s coordinates and determine if the
                shapes are
                too close or too far. It will then
                proceed to adjust the coordinates until they’re within the
                boundaries
                set. The ticks event allows you to listen
                for every change.</li>

        <h3 id="geojson-overview">GeoJSON Overview</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>GeoJSON is JSON that contains coordinates that can be used to
                draw maps.</li>
            <li>It’s recommended you verify the contents of your GeoJSON code
                before you
                use it. The geojson.io tool can help
                you fix and verify your changes.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="drawing-the-map-projections">Drawing the Map &amp; Projections</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The D3 geo library will take care of creating and drawing maps
                for you.</li>
            <li>Projections are formulas on how a 3d map looks on a 2D plane.
                There are
                various projections and standards on the
                d3 geo projection library page.</li>
            <li>Maps are drawn as is. If you would like to scale down the map,
                then you
                need to use the scale() function. You
                can use the translate() function to move the map as well.</li>
            <li>It’s preferred to store your GeoJSON code inside a separate file
                since
                there are so many coordinates.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="choropleth-maps">Choropleth Maps</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Choropleth maps are maps that use color to highlight data
                between
                states. Example: To show heat, you can use a
                dark shade of red to display heat intensity.</li>
            <li>There is a tool called color brewer that will generate shades of
                colors
                for your maps.</li>
            <li>It’s important to learn how to combine 2 data sources. You will
                most
                likely come across situations where you
                have the data for the map and actual data in separate files.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="adding-cities">Adding Cities</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Cities help make reading maps more clearer for users. Placing
                them on
                your map can make it easier to navigate
                around.</li>
            <li>The projection() function returns an array containing the x and
                y
                coordinates.</li>
            <li>The Math.sqrt() function is perfect for calculating the radius
                of a
                circle.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="panning-the-map">Panning the Map</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Panning is the ability to move a map in any direction without
                distorting
                the view.
                To get the current offset you can use the projection.translate()
                function which returns an array of the current
                coordinates.
                Since the coordinates system for SVG is top to bottom/left to
                right,
                then the values will most likely go in the
                opposite direction you’d like to go.
                Panning only works well for maps that are zoomed in so be sure
                to
                increase the scale and add a transition to
                your panning.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="dragging-the-map">Dragging the Map</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The D3 drag library is able to detect drag events. This includes
                touch
                on mobile devices.</li>
            <li>There’s a special property called d3.event that contains
                information
                about the drag event. This is not to be
                confused with the event object passed into javascript events.</li>
            <li>The d3.event.dx and d3.event.dy properties contain the distance
                that was
                dragged. The starting point is the
                offset for the projection.</li>
            <li>Dragging is only applied to the shape it’s added to. One simple
                track to
                make dragging available everywhere is
                to add an invisible shape.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="zooming">Zooming</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The D3 drag library can also handle zooming. Natural zooming and
                panning
                needs to be in sync with unnatural
                zooming and panning.</li>
            <li>You need to use the translateBy() function to move the map when
                panning
                is done in an unnatural manner.</li>
            <li>You need to use the scaleBy() function to zoom the map when
                zooming is
                done in an unnatural manner.</li>

        <h3 id="responsive-charts">Responsive Charts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>There are 2 solutions for creating responsive charts which is
                using SVG
                attributes or JavaScript events and
                redrawing the chart. SVG attributes is the more modern and
                elegant
                solution.</li>
            <li>The viewBox attribute determines the viewing area of your chart.
                The
                first 2 values are the starting points and
                the next 2 are width/height of the area.</li>
            <li>The preserveAspectRatio attribute is used to help with scaling
                on
                various devices. The xMidYMid ratio is usually
                the best for most charts/graphs.</li>
