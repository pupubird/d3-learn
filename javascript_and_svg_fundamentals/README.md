#### JavaScript Arrays & Objects

- Arrays are a way to store multiple values in 1 variable. Arrays can hold any type of data including numbers, strings, Booleans, functions and objects.
- Arrays will automatically assign each value inside it a position. A position is a way to reference a value in the array. Positions start at 0 and go up as more values are added.
- Objects are similar to arrays that can hold multiple values in a single variable. The difference is that you have to name your values along with the value.

#### What is SVG

- SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. It’s a special image format rather than the traditional jpg, jpeg, gif, png and bmp extensions.
- SVG images are created and edited through code. Not something that can necessarily be created sing cameras or image manipulation software like Photoshop.
- What makes SVG so great is that you can resize images without loss of quality. Image maintain their consistency and shape without having pixelated edges.
- SVG images require a lot of resources so you should only use them for basic images.

#### Creating SVG Images

- To create an SVG image you use the `<svg>` element. Most web browsers support SVG images by default so you shouldn’t face any compatibility issues.
- SVG images can have CSS classes and JavaScript events applied to them. This makes them easier to work with rather than a plain image.
- Not all CSS properties are supported. Some elements related to SVG require certain values and properties. You’ll learn what those are throughout this course.

#### SVG Rectangles

- SVG rectangle elements require that you set the width and height attributes. Otherwise nothing will appear on the screen.
- The fill attribute allows you to change the color of a SVG shape. You can’t use the background-color property on a SVG element. It will be ignored. The value for the fill can be named colors, rgb, hex and hsv.
- The stroke property will apply a border around a shape. Just like the fill property, this can only be applied to shapes. You also need to set the stroke-width or else the stroke won’t appear.

#### SVG Circles, Ellipses, and Lines

- The circle element requires that you define the r attribute which will set its radius. The radius is the distance from the center of the circle to any of it’s edges.
- The coordinate system works a bit differently. Circles are moved from their center points so you need to use the attributes cx and cy appropriately.
- An ellipse works similar to the circle element, but you’re required to set the radius for the x and y axis.
- Lines require that you set 2 coordinates which can be set using x1, y1, x2, and y2. Lines don’t have a fill so you need to use the stroke attribute to set the color.

#### SVG Polygons & Polylines

- Polygons are shapes with 3 or more straight sides. With the SVG polygon element you can create complex shapes.
- The polygon element requires 1 attribute which is the points. The points must be a set of coordinates where SVG will take care of drawing lines between them in order.
- Polylines are similar to polygons except polylines will not be closed. Despite the name, polylines will also have a fill. Set the fill attribute to none to have no fill.

#### SVG Paths

- Path elements allow you to create complex shapes. You can create sides that are either straight or curved.
- You are also allowed to create multiple shapes using one element.
- The path element works differently than the other shapes. You are required to input commands along with your coordinates to instruct SVG how to draw your shapes.
- There are 2 types of commands which are absolute and relative. Absolute commands are created using uppercase letters. Relative commands are created using lowercase letters.

#### SVG Text

- The text element allows you to create text inside SVG. Your text may not appear unless you set the x and y coordinates.
Naturally, SVG will not be able to break your text into multiple lines. In these cases you may want to use the tspan element to create multi line text.
- You can use regular HTML inside the text element, but you may need to apply special attributes in order for them to work. 

#### SVG Definitions and Groups

- Definitions allow you to create reusable elements. The benefit is that you won’t have to input the same values each time. Just define it once and you’re set!
- Any elements defined inside a definition will not be displayed. You have to use the use element and pass in the ID of the definition in order to display it.
- To group multiple elements together you can use the g element. The g element can hold any kind of shape and allows you to manage complex shapes easier.

#### SVG Text Paths

- You can create fancy text effects using text paths. Text paths allow you to use paths for text to be written on.
To create a text path you must first create a definition using the path element. You can use any commands and coordinates you want.
- Then you need to apply the textPath element to the text element and pass in the ID. The text must also be inside this element for the path to take effect.

#### SVG Clip Paths

- Clip paths allow you to hide certain parts of a shape using custom paths. Anything inside will appear while anything outside will disappear.
- Clip paths only apply to elements they’re applied to. If a shape that doesn’t have a clip path applied to it, but is touching the clip path, then it will still remain unaffected.

#### Creating SVG Elements with Illustrator

- Illustrator can be used to create SVG images. Just make sure you select svg as the file format when exporting.
- SVG files will have special attributes when you’re creating them as a separate file. This is just for the browser to better understand everything inside.
- D3 is used with SVG to create graphs and charts so be prepared to use it when we get started in the next section!
