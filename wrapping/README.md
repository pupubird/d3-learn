#### Responsive Charts

- There are 2 solutions for creating responsive charts which is using SVG attributes or JavaScript events and redrawing the chart. SVG attributes is the more modern and elegant solution.
- The viewBox attribute determines the viewing area of your chart. The first 2 values are the starting points and the next 2 are width/height of the area.
- The preserveAspectRatio attribute is used to help with scaling on various devices. The xMidYMid ratio is usually the best for most charts/graphs.
